Wiith all the precautionary steps that most companies around the world are taking to tackle COVID-19, most people are now required to work from home. I've summarized some tips on how to work from home comfortably.

## Switching between your desktop and work laptop
Switching between your personal and work computers is a bit of a pain especially when you have many peripherals and displays. For some of these peripherals, you can go wireless, but hey... tell that to your PC gamer friend.

KVM (Keyboard Video and Mouse) devices exist but I would not recommend purchasing these devices. These devices have limited support for different video interfaces (HDMI, DisplayPort, DVI, VGA) and most only come with VGA. The best solution to switch between devices is to separate out the monitor switching and the peripheral switching.

For switching displays between devices, I would recommend selecting a monitor with multiple video inputs and attach cables to each input to avoid reconnecting cables. For example, my BenQ 4K IPS 27 inch monitor has 4 video inputs: DVI, HDMI 1.4, HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort. I have my desktop connected to DisplayPort, work laptop connected to HDMI 2.0 and my Switch connected to HDMI 1.4. You should reserve the DisplayPort, USB-C/Thunderbolt 3.0 and HDMI 2.0 ports for devices that will take advantage of 4k 60 Hz. HDMI 1.4 can support 4k but the refresh rate will be at 30 Hz. You should also play around with the auto video signal detection feature on each of your monitors. Disable this feature if there's problems when you're switching between devices.

For switching peripherals between devices, install a USB switch. With a push of a button, you can switch your keyboard and mouse from your desktop to laptop and vice versa. I recommend getting a set of industrial velcro and install the USB switch underneath your desk for James Bond brownie points and maximum laziness. The one I purchased from Amazon has support for 4 USB 3.0 devices and an optional micro-USB input for additional power (it's unclear on the input amperage it'll supply but I used a spare Apple USB charger for an iPhone which supplies 2A and the switch can power a DAC).

In the end, you'll be pressing 1 button for your peripherals and a few buttons (or none) on your monitor(s) to switch between your devices. No more crawling behind your desk and reconnecting cables :)

## Ensure your home office space is comfortable
Comfort is really subjective. Some people prefer to be clutter-free and worship Marie Kondo. Others can work in an office space where sticky notes are everywhere, coffee cups/sparkling water/green tea everywhere and other random devices/peripherals/things scattered. I'm the latter but I try to make an effort to be a bit clutter-free.

An easy way to ensure that your home office environment is comfortable to work in is to make sure that your setup at home is similar or better than your workplace environment (hopefully, your workplace office environment is good to work in). If you have 2 monitors at work, replicate that. If your work office is clutter-free and clean, make sure your home office is clutter free. If you need a blanket to keep warm, you probably have plenty at home to use. If you have office plants, bring them home if you can cuz they're going to need to be watered. Hopefully, it's not too late...

Make sure your family, roommates or pets don't interrupt you while doing work. Chores can wait a bit but if you're sharing an area frequently such as the kitchen or dining area, maintain it and keep it clean (especially during this COVID-19 pandemic).

For clothing, no one cares too much but it helps psychologically to wear the same clothing as you would at the office. There's a [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrdq.1208) that shows that workers feel more "authoritative, trustworthy, and competent when wearing formal business attire.

## Make sure your desk setup is ergonomically fit for you
For most people, working from a beanbag, couch or bed is alright for an hour or two at night but it might not be healthy if you do it for an entire day. Since you're spending 8 or more hours a day in your home office, it's best to research and find a desk and seat setup that works best for you. 

For an office chair, it's recommended to try out the office chair before purchasing. If you're ordering online, ensure that there's a reasonable return policy. I'm currently using the ErgoChair 2 from Autonomous. The lumbar support, tilt, seat length and height are all adjustable. You can also adjust the back to lean back which is nice if you want to relax or do some reading. The cost of the chair was around USD 350 total and shipping completed in 3 business days (middle of March 2020). I would recommend to set your budget to however much you would spend on a new mattress. You spend 8 hours on your mattress (hopefully) and your other 8 hours is on your chair, so choosing a chair is probably the most important piece of furniture in your home office.

**ErgoChair 2. There's a bunch of color options**

For a straightforward desk, I recommend building your own from Ikea or Home Depot. My preference is to have a lot of room underneat my desk and a lot of surface area on my desk so I won't feel cramped in terms of space. For my desk, I built mine from Ikea using the Gerton Beech Tabletop and 4 Gerton Chrome legs. The legs are adjusted to a comfortable height for me while I type (ergonomists recommend a 90 degree bend in your elbows). If you want to adjust the height for sitting and standing, you can switch the legs for a standing desk frame. Whether if you go with fixed height legs or a standing desk frame, make sure your top is solid (ie. avoid the Ikea honeycomb table tops or other cardboard-based table tops).

Monitor arms can also improve ergonomics. Usually the stands that come with your monitor are not that adjustable in terms of height. With monitor arms, it's easier to adjust the height and distance from the monitor which is good for ergonomics. In addition, it frees up your desk space so you can put all your snacks and coffee mugs. 

For keyboard and mouse, I use a Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 at work. It's a cheap ergonomic keyboard and so far it's really reliabile (I spilt coffee on it) and comfortable use. For home, I'm using a Coolermaster CM Storm Cherry MX Blue Ten Keyless Mechanical Keyboard with a thick wrist rest. It's not as ergonomic as the Microsoft Keyboard at work but it's a lot more comfortable than those really slim chiclet keyboards. 


## Take time to focus on individual work and queue up meetings/1:1 calls into blocks
If you're in a profession that demands a lot more individual work versus meetings (ie. software engineering), take advantage of being sheltered at home where interuptions are minimized. At the workplace, it's very convenient for people to come to your cube or desk for work or non-work related topics. If it's work-related, there are some individuals who may ask you questions without thinking through on their problem or question. Since people can't physically contact you, they would have to process and buffer their question in their mind first before sending the question out. Once you receive the question, you can answer the question at the right time. Without buffers, it's hard to get real work done due to interruptions. In other words, for efficient communication (people or computer networks), buffering is required.

Of course, even individual work oriented jobs require a great deal of communication. You can maximize your individual work time by queueing up meetings or one-on-one's with your collaborators, PM or manager. Avoid gaps between meetings since individaul work requires a longer period of focus. Make use of your online calendar to block out these times or to schedule meetings. Utilize online collaborative office tools such as Google Docs to ensure people on your team are on the same page. In Google Docs, you can create discussions within the document which further reduces the amount of meetings required.


## Remember to take breaks and socialize (virutally)
So far after working an extended period at home, I realize that I would forget to take lunch. Usually at work, my coworkers would remind me about lunch and I would go to avoid lineups and to socialize (also, I'm usually hungry at noon). At home, even though I would get hungry, I would forget about normal lunch and dinner time. If you're like me, you probably need to set up a reminder. 

Since public officials everywhere (Canada and the US) have urged the public to shelter in place, it's not recommended to see your coworkers or friends physically. Instead, you can use video chat or IM to talk to people online. Maybe have lunch or a coffee break virtually? Or have a bit of fun and turn it into a podcast? It'll be interesting to see what our society will do when most people are forced to stay at home.

## Conclusion

Key take aways on how to work from home:

- Make sure your home office environment is comfortable and ergonomic with the proper equipment. It's an investment for yourself!
- Take advantage of the physical distance between other coworkers to do individual work
- Take breaks and socialize!
