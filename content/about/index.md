Hello! I'm Andy Leung. I am a Software Engineer living and working in the Santa Clara County, CA. I joined Arista Networks after graduating with a BASc in Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo (Waterloo, Canada) in 2017. This blog is mostly on random programming/devops issues and other topics.

This blog is written with Hugo and Forestry.
